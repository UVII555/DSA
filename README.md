# DSA (Placement Prep)

This repo is organized by topic with 20 problems per topic from basic to advanced. Each topic folder contains:
- `README.md` with learning goals, a 20-problem practice list, and resources
- `problems/` with Java solution stubs
- `solutions/` for your final solutions
- `notes/` for topic notes

## How to Use
1. Pick a topic folder.
2. Read `README.md` for the 20-problem list.
3. Solve problems in `problems/` and move final code to `solutions/`.

## Conventions
- File naming: `01_problem_slug.java`, `02_problem_slug.java`, ...
- One class per file, class name matches file name (CamelCase)

## Progress
Update `PROGRESS.md` as you go.
